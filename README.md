# Handwritten Character Recognition using CNN

## Overview:

The Handwritten Character Recognition project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing handwritten characters. Implemented in Python using Scikit-Learn and Keras, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of over 95% on test data. The project involves dataset collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and rigorous testing to ensure robust performance across various handwriting styles and conditions.

## Key Achievements:

1. **High-Accuracy Model:**
   - Formulated a machine learning model achieving over 95% accuracy on test data for recognizing handwritten characters.

2. **Dataset Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collected and preprocessed a dataset comprising over 10,000 handwritten characters.
   - Applied data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction techniques to enhance model training.

3. **Extensive Testing and Validation:**
   - Conducted rigorous testing and validation procedures to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Ensured robustness to different handwriting styles and conditions for real-world applicability.
